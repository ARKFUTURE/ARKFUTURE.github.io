                    (requires the nokicks module).
 R                  Blocks unregistered users from joining (requires
                    the account module).

                     a +u channel (requires the auditorium module).
 auditorium-vis      Permission required to be visible in a +u channel
                     (requires the auditorium module).
 blockcolor          Channel mode +c
 filter              Channel mode +g
 flood               Channel mode +f
 nickflood           Channel mode +F
 noctcp              Channel mode +C
 nonick              Channel mode +N
 nonotice            Channel mode +T
 regmoderated        Channel mode +M
 repeat              Channel mode +E
 stripcolor          Channel mode +S
 topiclock           Channel mode +t

NOTE: A large number of these modes are dependent upon server-side modules
being loaded by a server/network administrator. The actual modes available
on your network may be very different to this list. Please consult your
help channel if you have any questions.

<helptopic key="extbans" title="[封禁]类型" value="
Extbans are split into two types; matching extbans, which match on
users in additional ways, and acting extbans, which restrict users
in different ways to a standard ban.

To use an extban, simply set +b <ban>or +e <ban>with it as the ban,
instead of a normal nick!user@host mask, to ban or exempt matching
users. Ban exceptions on acting extbans exempt that user from matching
an extban of that type, and from any channel mode corresponding to the
restriction. Matching extbans may also be used for invite exceptions by
setting +I <extban>.

Matching extbans:

 a:<mask>     Matches user with both a matching banmask and real name,
               where <mask>is in the format nick!user@host+realname
               (requires realnameban module).
 j:<channel>  Matches anyone in the given channel. Does not support
               wildcards (requires the channelban module).
 n:<class>    Matches users in a matching connect class (requires
               the classban module).
 r:<realname> Matches users with a matching real name (requires the
               realnameban module).
 s:<server>   Matches users on a matching server (requires the
               serverban module).
 z:<tlsfp>    Matches users having the given TLS certificate
               fingerprint (requires the sslmodes module).
 w:<gateway>  Matches users who are connecting via a WebIRC gateway that
               matches <gateway>.
 O:<opertype> Matches server operators of a matching type, mostly
               useful as an invite exception (requires the
               operchans module).
 R:<account>  Matches users logged into a matching account (requires
               the account module).
 U:<banmask>  Matches unregistered users matching the given banmask.
               (requires the account module).

Acting extbans:

 c:<banmask>  Blocks any messages that contain formatting codes from
               matching users (requires the blockcolor module).
 m:<banmask>  Blocks messages from matching users (requires the muteban
               module). Users with +v or above are not affected.
 A:<banmask>  Blocks invites by matching users even when +A is set
               (requires the allowinvite module).
 B:<banmask>  Blocks all capital or nearly all capital messages from
               matching users (requires the blockcaps module).
 C:<banmask>  Blocks CTCPs from matching users (requires the noctcp
               module).
 N:<banmask>  Blocks nick changes from matching users (requires
               the nonicks module).
 Q:<banmask>  Blocks kicks by matching users (requires the nokicks
               module).
 S:<banmask>  Strips formatting codes from messages from matching
               users (requires the stripcolor module).
 T:<banmask>  Blocks notices from matching users (requires the
               nonotice module).

A ban given to an Acting extban may either be a nick!user@host mask
(unless stated otherwise), matched against users as for a normal ban,
or a Matching extban.

There is an additional special type of extended ban, a redirect ban:

 Redirect      n!u@h#channel will redirect the banned user to #channel
               when they try to join (requires the banredirect module).
